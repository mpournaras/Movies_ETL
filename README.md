# Movies_ETL

This code is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I created a function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
